Project Overview
This project analyzes health insurance plan availability, pricing differences, and uninsured population trends in the United States. The goal is to move beyond basic statistics and examine meaningful patterns that help explain differences in cost, coverage options, and insurance gaps.
The analysis combines federal marketplace plan data with demographic insurance coverage data to explore how plan offerings and pricing relate to uninsured rates across income and gender groups.

This project is guided by the following analytical questions:
1. How does the health insurance marketplace in Tennessee compare to the national market?
   a. Are the same insurers dominant?

2. Do plans that include dental or vision coverage cost significantly more than plans without these benefits?
   a. What is the average premium difference?
   b. Does the difference vary by metal level (Bronze, Silver, Gold)?
3. How does the uninsured rate vary across income levels in the United States?
   a. At what income level is the uninsured rate highest?
   b. Are there clear affordability gaps?
4. Are there gender differences in uninsured rates?
   a. Is one gender more likely to be uninsured?
   b. How large is the difference?
5. What patterns emerge when comparing plan cost, plan availability, and uninsured populations?
   a. Which groups appear most affected by cost or access barriers?
